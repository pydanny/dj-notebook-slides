Come and work with me to help save the planet

----

## Hello Paris! 🇫🇷

My first time here!

----

## Hello Paris! 🇫🇷

I came all the way here from London

to tell you about [dj-notebook]()

----

## Hello Paris! 🇫🇷

Yes, I'm struggling through

- delicious food 🍲
- delightful wine 🍷
- incredible history 🏰
- world-class art 🎨

to tell you about [dj-notebook]()

----

## My Mission Today

Convince you to use [dj-notebook]() 

and 

stop using [django-extensions shell-plus]() directly

----

### [dj-notebook]() is a

# wrapper 

### around [shell_plus]()

----

#### Makes running django-extentions

#### in Jupyter notebook trivial

```python
# measurements.ipynb
from dj_notebook import activate
plus = activate()
```

----

### Works everywhere

- Web
- VSCode
- PyCharm
- Emacs
- Vim

Anywhere where Jupyter notebooks can be run

----

## Easy-to-extend

----

### Lots of extra features

----

## Rather than tell you about the features

----

# I'm going to show you

----

# [DEMO TIME]()
